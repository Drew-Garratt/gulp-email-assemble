# Gulp Email Assemble

Designing and testing emails was a pain. HTML tables, inline CSS, various devices and clients to test, and varying support for the latest web standards.

This Gulp workflow simplifies things.

1. Compiles your SCSS to CSS

2. Builds your HTML email templates

3. Inlines your CSS

4. Compresses and uploads images to a CDN (optional)
