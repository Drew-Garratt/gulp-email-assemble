Ok

So we need to use gulp-rename to change the destination paths for all assets to output paths...
we also need gulp-cached to ensure that only changed files make it through the pipe on watch

So it should run something like

All watches include assemble and juice...

But only the assemble watch will re-load the source files (as nothing should have changed otherwise) Lazypipe??

Sass task will watch for all sass in shared and emails. It will process and output the sass to the dist and assemble the pages and then juice them together

Image task will not update assemble..

Data task will watch all data. It will re-load the data into assemble (just the data??? seems safe) and re-run assemble and juice

All task will need to update live-reload
